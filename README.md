# SB Hacks VII API Requests Collection

**Workshop date:**  January 16th, 2020 @ 3pm PST  
**Hosted by:**  Jayleen Li and Daniel Guo from SB Hacks

This repo is meant to serve as a easy plug-n-play for API requests in popular hackathon languages like Python, JavaScript, and Node.js. Take the examples you see and copy paste them as you see fit! 

**Workshop description:**
Join SB Hacks for a introductory workshop on APIs and what they are, as well how to incorporate them into your hackathon projects quickly! Although there are so many ways to incorporate APIs, in the workshop we will show how call the Yelp API in a Flask app and a non authorized API in a pure front end (HTML/CSS/JavaScript) project.

This workshop is intended for those with some coding knowledge and some understanding of basic web development.
